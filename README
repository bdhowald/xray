XRay provides a lightweight yet powerful toolbox for troubleshooting Ruby
applications when things stop making sense. Includes GDB and DTrace tooling.

*** GDB ***


  Copy +gdb_macros+ file provided in the gem as your ~/.gdbinit file.

*** Fire DTrace Application Probes ***

  See XRay::DTrace::Tracer

*** Out-of-the-box Rails DTrace Instrumentation ***

  You are one require away from triggering automatically DTrace events for 
  Rails requests, database access and template rendering. As simple as 

     # environment.rb
     Rails::Initializer.run do |config|

       ...

       config.after_initialize do
         require "xray/dtrace/rails/enable_tracing"
       end  
     end
